### Tasks 📝

Implement User Stories

## Tech Stack 🛠️

- Postgres for the database management system 🐘
- Haskell and Servant for the server-side API 🌐
- React Native Elements for command-line style UI 🎨

## Gameplay Mechanics⚙️

- CRGE: The CRGE is a tool that can be used to generate random events, NPCs, and other elements of the game world, allowing for a more dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience 🎲 
- Wraith: The Oblivion Mechanics:  incorporated mechanics such as the afterlife, the Shadows, the Tempest, and the factions 🧟‍♀️ 

## User Interface and Features 💻🕹️

- Command line UI: The game will use a command line UI to create a more imagination-based  gameplay experience 💻
- CRGE Integration: The game should allow players to use the CRGE to generate events, NPCs, and other elements of the game world 🎲
- Exploration and Interaction: Players should be able to navigate the afterlife, interact w/ other wraiths, and perform various actions, such as completing quests, battling supernatural entities, and dealing w/ their unfinished business 🕵️‍♀️
- Factions: The game should allow players to align themselves w/ various factions and engage in faction-specific quests, missions, and objectives 🔮
- Shadows and the Tempest: The game should include mechanics that represent the effects of the Shadows and the Tempest on the player's psyche and health 💀💨
- Interactive Tutorial: The game should include a fun and interactive tutorial that teaches new players the mechanics of the game, including the CRGE and the command line UI

## Development Process 🧑‍💻

- Develop a detailed plan for MVP, focusing on core mechanics and features of the game, including the CRGE, command line UI built using React Native Elements., and interactive tutorial 📈
- Create a database schema and API endpoints that support the core gameplay mechanics and user interface features 
- Develop a command line UI that allows players to interact w/ the game world, use the CRGE, and engage w/ the various factions, as well as an interactive tutorial that teaches new players the mechanics of the game and  that looks like a command prompt or terminal, and handles user input using the TextInput component and is stylied using properties to make the TextInput look like a command prompt
- Test the MVP and gather feedback from users to identify areas that need improvement or additional features
- Refine and improve the game based on user feedback, adding new features as needed
