# Night Lilies

Night Lilies is a MUD (multi-user dungeon) based on the Wraith: The Oblivion tabletop role-playing game. The game will incorporate the CRGE (Conjectural Roleplaying GM Emulator) to generate dynamic events, NPCs, and other elements of the game world. The game will use a command line / terminal-style UI.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the app with `expo start`.

## MVP Plan

### User Stories

1. As a player, I want to be able to create a character, choose a name, and select a race.
2. As a player, I want to be able to move my character around the game world using text-based commands.
3. As a player, I want to be able to interact with non-player characters (NPCs) using text-based commands.
4. As a player, I want to be able to see a list of available commands and their descriptions.
5. As a player, I want to be able to see my character's status, including health and inventory.
6. As a player, I want to be able to engage in combat with NPCs using text-based commands.

### Tasks

1. Implement a character creation process that allows players to choose a name and race.
2. Implement a system for moving a character around the game world using text-based commands.
3. Implement a system for interacting with NPCs using text-based commands.
4. Implement a help command that displays a list of available commands and their descriptions.
5. Implement a system for displaying a character's status, including health and inventory.
6. Implement a combat system that allows players to engage in combat with NPCs using text-based commands.

## Tech Stack

- Postgres for the database management system
- Haskell and Servant for the server-side API
- React Native Elements

## Gameplay Mechanics

- CRGE: The CRGE is a tool that can be used to generate random events, NPCs, and other elements of the game world, allowing for a more dynamic and unpredictable gameplay experience.
- Wraith: The Oblivion Mechanics: You'll also need to incorporate the mechanics of Wraith: The Oblivion into the game, such as the afterlife, the Shadows, the Tempest, and the factions.

## User Interface and Features

- Command Line / Terminal-Style UI: The game will use a command line / terminal-style UI to create a more immersive and interactive gameplay experience.
- CRGE Integration: The game should allow players to use the CRGE to generate events, NPCs, and other elements of the game world.
- Exploration and Interaction: Players should be able to navigate the afterlife, interact with other wraiths, and perform various actions, such as completing quests, battling supernatural entities, and dealing with their unfinished business.
- Factions: The game should allow players to align themselves with various factions and engage in faction-specific quests, missions, and objectives.
- Shadows and the Tempest: The game should include mechanics that represent the effects of the Shadows and the Tempest on the player's psyche and health.
- Interactive Tutorial: The game should include a fun and interactive tutorial that teaches new players the mechanics of the game, including the CRGE and the command line / terminal-style UI.

## Development Process

- Conduct thorough research on the CRGE and Wraith: The Oblivion, including the game mechanics, lore, and themes.
- Develop a detailed plan for your MVP, focusing on the core mechanics and features of the game, including the integration of the CRGE and the command line / terminal-style UI, as well as the interactive tutorial.
- Create a database schema and API endpoints that support the core gameplay mechanics and user interface features.
- Develop a command line / terminal-style UI that allows players to interact with the game world, use the CRGE, and engage with the various factions, as well as an interactive tutorial that teaches new players the mechanics of the game.
- Test the MVP and gather feedback from users to identify areas that need improvement or additional features.
- Refine and improve the game based on user feedback, adding new features as needed.
